This is my special new Blaupunkt kettle... so what's so special about it, you might ask.\
Well besides the fact that it has a name that sounds like it could be used in a comic strip speech/noise bubble to express the sound a villain might make when he is simultaneously kicked in stomach by Batman and hit over the head with a full unopened can of masonry paint by Robin... besides that... I bought it on Friday the 13th, which is today. So far I have had no misfortunes... and if things stay that way, I feel confident that it is reasonable to attribute the serenity of this particular Friday to my new lucky kettle... the charm of the lucky kettle counteracting any Friday the 13th malevolence...\
Although if, say, I badly stub my toe on my way to bed for instance, it will just be my new neutral kettle... This is a defining moment for new kettle made by the company with the funny name who have been making stuff since 1924...
