  heading: Why drum?
  text: >-
    You don't know anything about drums... you should just quit!

    Quit! Get out of here! Stop paying your mortgage.

    You should default on your mortgage and steal bread... move to France first though.

    And steal all the bread you could possibly eat in five sittings... then eat it in one sitting. In a public place. And laugh... Laugh loudly until passers-bys become frightened...

    Then come back here... Then... you'll be ready...

  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
