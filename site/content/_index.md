  heading: Why drum?
  text: >-
    You don't know anything about drumming... you should just quit!

    Quit! Get out of here! Stop paying your mortgage.

    You should default on your mortgage and steal bread... move to France first though.

    And steal all the bread you could possibly eat in five sittings... then eat it in one sitting. In a public place. And laugh... Laugh loudly until the passers-bys become frightened...

    Then come back here... Then... you'll be ready...

    text: We offer a small nothings, but a carefully curated selection of whimsicals
      and tools for opening sardine tins on which the ring-pull has broken
      off... but these tools don't work anyway... So just put down that sardine
      tin... give up, it's no use. You should have been more careful with the
      ring-pull in the first place.

  text: Coffee is an amazing part of human culture but it has a dark side too –
    one of colonialism and mindless abuse of natural resources and human lives.
    We want to turn this around and return the coffee trade to the drink’s
    exhilarating, empowering and unifying nature.
